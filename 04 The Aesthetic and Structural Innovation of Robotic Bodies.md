Abstract
This paper proposes a novel robotic body based on a nonlinear scissor mechanism with forward bending and gradient link lengths. By introducing a non-uniform geometric configuration into the conventional scissor structure, a conical spatial topology is formed, effectively overcoming the inherent base contraction issue observed in traditional linear scissor mechanisms during horizontal extension.
The proposed structure achieves a combination of high stiffness, large workspace, high payload capacity, and low energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the relationship between actuator displacement and end-effector displacement can be approximated as a linear function. Compared with traditional articulated robots, which rely on complex high-order nonlinear kinematic models, the proposed system simplifies the kinematics into a first-order linear equation, significantly reducing control complexity.
Furthermore, the structure eliminates the need for high-precision reducers, offering advantages such as low cost, structural simplicity, and suitability for confined workspace applications. This research introduces a new paradigm for next-generation robotic body design.

I. Introduction
Robotic manipulators are widely used in industrial automation, medical systems, rehabilitation, and service industries. With the rapid integration of artificial intelligence and physical systems, robotics is entering a new era of expansion.
Traditional robotic arms typically adopt articulated joint structures driven by electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic actuators [1]. However, such systems require high-ratio precision reducers, leading to high manufacturing cost and complexity [2]. Additionally, the use of precision gear systems increases weight and volume, reduces payload efficiency, and complicates installation and maintenance [3].
Moreover, the forward and inverse kinematics of articulated robots involve complex nonlinear equations [4], increasing computational cost and limiting accessibility for broader engineering applications.
To address these challenges, this paper introduces a nonlinear scissor-based telescopic robotic arm. The key innovation lies in:
Forward-bent links
Gradually decreasing link lengths
Topological cone space configuration
This design ensures that the base span does not shrink during extension, thereby overcoming instability issues inherent in traditional scissor mechanisms and significantly improving load capacity and structural stability.


II. System Design
A. Overall Architecture
The proposed robot consists of:
Conical telescopic arm
End-effector
Drive system
Column support
Rotational base
The telescopic arm serves as the core execution unit, with internal actuation mechanisms driving extension and contraction.

B. Conical Telescopic Arm
The arm is composed of multiple scissor units and a semi-scissor unit connected in series:
Each scissor unit consists of two hinged links
Adjacent units are connected via pivot joints
The semi-scissor unit provides terminal constraint
Key structural characteristics include:
Link lengths decrease monotonically from base to tip
Each link exhibits forward bending
Bending angles vary gradually along the arm
The entire structure forms a conical topology (0°–80°)


C. Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics
Unlike traditional articulated robots, whose kinematics are highly nonlinear, experimental results reveal that the proposed structure exhibits an approximately linear mapping between input and output.

This linearization significantly reduces computational complexity, enabling high-precision control using low-cost controllers.
Further analysis indicates that:
The average transmission ratio ≈ 512.7
Local transmission ratio increases with stroke
This non-uniform amplification behavior is attributed to the conical gradient geometry, which improves load distribution and mechanical efficiency.
The simplification of robot kinematic equations and inverses simplifies the robot control system, thereby enhancing the robot's computing power.


D. Experimental Setup and Validation
Prototype specifications:
Arm length: 3.5 m
Payload: 25 kg
Actuation: electric cylinder with encoder feedback
Experimental data confirm:
Near-linear displacement mapping
Increasing local transmission ratio along extension
This phenomenon demonstrates that structural symmetry leads to simplified kinematics despite geometric complexity.


III. Working Principle
The robot operates by actuating relative motion between adjacent scissor units, resulting in synchronized extension or contraction.
Key characteristics:
Linear motion output
Triangular support-like stability
Wide base for stiffness
Narrow tip for confined workspace
The actuator stroke is only 5%–10% of total extension, significantly reducing actuator size and system cost.

IV. Advantages
1) High Stability and Load Capacity
The conical symmetric structure enhances rigidity and load-bearing capability.
2) Ultra-Low Energy Consumption
Compared with conventional robots requiring kilowatt-level motors, the proposed system operates at approximately 50 W, due to:
Planar motion (no gravity compensation)
Reduced rotational inertia
3) No Precision Reducers Required
Eliminates ~40% of robot cost associated with reducers.
4) Simplified Control Algorithms
Linear kinematics enable accessibility even for low-level developers, greatly expanding adoption.
5) Robots of different sizes and shapes can be constructed in a modular fashion. 
Single scissor-type modules can be connected in series or parallel to construct various types of robots, even heavy duty robots. For example in Fig.3, It used less scissor-type modules to construct a compact robot as well.
